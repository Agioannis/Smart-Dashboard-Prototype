# Deployment

Client (GitHub Pages)
- Ensure `client/package.json` contains `"homepage": "."` (already present).
- Workflow `.github/workflows/deploy-client.yml` builds `client` and publishes `client/build` to the `gh-pages` branch on pushes to `main`.
- After a successful run, enable Pages in GitHub > Settings > Pages:
  - Source: `gh-pages` branch / root
  - Site URL: `https://<GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io/<REPO_NAME>`

Server (Render)
- Create a new Web Service in Render and connect the GitHub repo.
- Settings:
  - Root directory: `/server`
  - Build command: `npm install`
  - Start command: `node app.js` (or `npm start` if defined)
- Add environment variables (MONGODB_URI, API keys, NODE_ENV=production).
- Render will provide a public URL like `https://<your-service>.onrender.com`.

Client â†’ Server
- Set `REACT_APP_API_URL=https://<your-service>.onrender.com` in your client environment (used at build time), commit, and push to trigger a new Pages deploy.

Quick PowerShell commands (from repo root)
- git add .github/workflows/deploy-client.yml README_DEPLOY.md
- git commit -m "ci: add gh-pages deploy workflow and deployment README"
- git push origin main

If you want, I can also:
- Append the variables import to `client/src/index.js` and the App.css overrides for dark mode now. Which should I do next?
